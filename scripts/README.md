# Analysis PR  Scripts Introduction

[toc]

## Overview

In the open source community, we always need to quantify the workload of a new PR and the indicators of changes made to the entire project. This will help us better evaluate the new PR and quantify its contribution from multiple perspectives.

I will introduce the features and usage methods of these two scripts separately.

# PR Workload Analysis Script Guide

This Python script analyzes the workload of a GitHub pull request (PR) by examining the files changed in the PR, evaluating their complexity, and estimating the overall effort required. It supports both C++ and Python files and calculates workload based on cyclomatic complexity, code level, and changes made in the PR.

---

## Features
1. **Workload Estimation**:
   - Calculates workload based on additions, deletions, and code complexity.
   - Supports configurable complexity levels for different directories.
   
2. **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis**:
   - Analyzes function complexity using `lizard` for supported file types.

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Fetches PR details, file changes, and commit history using the GitHub API.

---

## Prerequisites
1. **Python Environment**:
   - Python 3.6+ is required.
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install requests lizard
     ```

2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**:
   - Generate a GitHub token with `repo` and `read:org` permissions.
   
3. **Environment Variables**:
   
   ：Set the following required variables:
   
   - `PR_NUMBER`: The pull request number for which metrics need to be fetched.
   - `OWNER`: The owner of the repository (e.g., `my-org`).
   - `REPO`: The name of the repository (e.g., `my-repo`).
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: The token for authenticating with the Github API.
   
   - Optional variables (with default values):
     - `DEFAULT_CODE_LEVEL`: Default code complexity level (`1`).
     - `DEFAULT_NOT_ANALYSE_COMPLEXITY`: Default complexity for non-analyzed files (`1`).
     - `DEFAULT_CPP_ENDS_WITH_FILE`: File extensions to analyze (`.cpp, .h, .hpp, .m, .mm, .cc` ）for C++
     - `DEFAULT_PYTHON_ENDS_WITH_FILE `：File extensions to analyze (`.py` ）for Python

---

## How to Run the Script

**Set Environment Variables And Run the Script**:

```bash
python.exe workload_analyzation.py --owner JackLau1222 --repo OpenConverter --pr-number 36 --token yourtoken 
```

or you can add more parameters 

````
python.exe workload_analyzation.py --owner JackLau1222 --repo OpenConverter --pr-number 36 --token yourtoken --default-code-level 1 --default-not-analyse-complexity 1 --default-cpp-ends-with-file .cpp,.h,.hpp,.m,.mm,.cc --default-python-ends-with-file .py 
````

## Script Output

The script will output:

- **Estimated workload**: A numerical value representing the estimated effort.
- **Changed lines**: Total number of lines added and deleted in the PR.
- Detailed information on modified files, including function complexity, changed lines, and directory complexity.

Example output:

```
textCopy codeEstimated workload for PR 123: 15.75
Estimated changedLine for PR 123: 150
File path: src/transcoder/video.cpp
File changed lines: 45
Number of functions: 5
Complexity Level: 10
  ——The information of changed function——
  1.Function: processVideo
  2.Complexity: 3
  3.Lines: 25
  4.CodeLevel: 10
```

## Customization

You can customize the script by modifying:

- **Complexity Levels**: Update the `CodeLevel` class to redefine weights.
- **File Extensions**: Adjust `DEFAULT_CPP_ENDS_WITH_FILE` and `DEFAULT_PYTHON_ENDS_WITH_FILE` for additional file types.

------

## Troubleshooting

1. **Error: "No files found in the PR"**:
   - Ensure the `PR_NUMBER`, `OWNER`, and `REPO` environment variables are set correctly.
2. **Authentication Error**:
   - Verify the GitHub token's validity and scope.
3. **API Rate Limits**:
   - Use a token with higher API limits if analyzing large PRs frequently.

------

## Example

### Input:

Environment Variables:

```
PR_NUMBER=456
OWNER=my-org
REPO=my-repo
GITHUB_TOKEN=my-github-token
```

### Output:

```

# SonarCloud Metrics Fetcher Script Guide

This guide explains how to use the provided Python script to fetch metrics from the SonarCloud API for a specified pull request (PR) and repository.

## Features

1. **PR Multi-dimensional Analysis**:
   - Multi-dimensional Analyzes PR information by SonarCloud Metrics Fetcher 

2. **Reliable Information Integration**:
   - Fetches PR details, file changes, and commit history using the SonarCloud Metrics API.
3. **Rate Metrics for PR**:
   - Set some rate metrics for PR and give a better way to visualization change that in PR

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Required Python Libraries

   : Install the necessary libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **SonarCloud API Token**: Obtain a token from your SonarCloud account.

4. Environment Variables

   : Set the following environment variables:

   - `PR_NUMBER`: The pull request number for which metrics need to be fetched.
   - `OWNER`: The owner of the repository (e.g., `my-org`).
   - `REPO`: The name of the repository (e.g., `my-repo`).
   - `SONARCLOUD_API_TOKEN`: The token for authenticating with the SonarCloud API.
   - `OUTPUT_TYPE`： Determines which metrics to fetch. Options are:
     - `RATE`: Fetch only rate metrics.
     - `NON_RATE`: Fetch only non-rate metrics.
     - `ALL` (default): Fetch both rate and non-rate metrics.

## How to Run the Script

**Set Environment Variables And Run the Script**:

```bash
python.exe quality_rate.py --owner JackLau1222 --repo OpenConverter --pr-number 36 --token yourtoken --output-type ALL
```

## Script Output

The script fetches and categorizes the metrics into two groups:

### Rate Metrics

These metrics have a rating scale (e.g., A, B, C, D, E). The script will output them in the following format:

```
Rate Metrics:
- new_reliability_rating: A
- new_security_rating: B
```

### Non-Rate Metrics

These metrics display raw numerical values. The script will output them in the following format:

```
Non-Rate Metrics:
- new_technical_debt: 5
- new_branch_coverage: 85.3
```

## Customization

### Adjust Metrics

You can customize the rate and non-rate metrics in the script by modifying the `rate_metrics` and `non_rate_metrics` lists.

### Modify Output

You can enhance or format the output further by editing the respective `print` statements in the script.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Missing Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set.
   - If a variable is missing, the script will raise an error.
2. **Authentication Error**:
   - If the API token is invalid or missing, the script will fail to fetch data.
   - Verify the token and ensure it has the necessary permissions.
3. **Invalid Repository or PR**:
   - Ensure `OWNER`, `REPO`, and `PR_NUMBER` point to a valid repository and pull request.
   - Double-check the formatting of the `OWNER` and `REPO` values.
4. **SonarCloud API Issues**:
   - If the SonarCloud API is down or rate-limiting applies, the script may fail.
   - Retry after some time or check the SonarCloud status.

## Example

### Input:

Environment Variables:

```
python.exe quality_rate.py --owner JackLau1222 --repo OpenConverter --pr-number 36 --token yourtoken --output-type ALL
```

### Output:

```
Metrics:
Rate Metrics:
- new_reliability_rating: A
- new_security_rating: B
Non-Rate Metrics:
(No output as OUTPUT_TYPE is set to RATE)
```
